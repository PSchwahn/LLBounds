# LLBounds

A project for computing lower bounds for the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on normal homogeneous spaces G/H with G simple.

Running the code requires an installation of both Sage and LiE.

Open sage in a terminal and type: load("Sym2Bounds.sage")

Then enjoy the implemented functionalities, or navigate to the subfolders you are interested in and load the .sage files there to see what happens.

TODO: Update nomenclature, clean up further, reset .sage files, document usage
